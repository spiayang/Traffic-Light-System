# Traffic-Light-System

Simulates a real-world traffic system at a T-intersection, including changing traffic lights, pedestrian lights, street lights that turn on and off according to its environment, and a gate that opens by detecting movement and light.

# Description

`Traffic System Model.png` is a digital model of the traffic system. It was created using SolidWorks for planning and visualization purposes.

`Traffic Circuit.png` is a digital model of the circuit used. It was created in TinkerCAD and includes all wiring and components of the traffic system. The physical circuit was later completed using this model.

`Traffic Code.ino` contains all the code used in the traffic system.

`ISP Circuit Submission - includes instruction manual.pdf` contains a picture of the digital circuit, the code, as well as a more detailed technical explanation for the purpose of each component of the system.

`ISP - Report.pdf` is the final report for the project and includes a more general explanation for each component of the system and reflection on the process.
